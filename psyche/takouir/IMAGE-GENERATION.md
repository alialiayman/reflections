"Create a surreal and symbolic illustration of the human psyche inspired by the imagery in Surah At-Takwir (Quran 81). The psyche is depicted as a vast inner universe composed of a sun (clarity), stars (values and dreams), mountains (stability), seas (emotions), and love between people. It also contains wild beasts — lions, snakes, gorillas — representing primal instincts. In a moment of inner collapse, the sun darkens, stars fall, mountains drift, love is lost, beasts are restless, and the seas burn with fire, symbolizing the loss of mercy, hope, and emotional harmony. Deep within, a hidden light — the truth-seeking core of the soul — begins to awaken, critically evaluating what is heard and discerning divine truth. The scene gradually shifts from night’s darkness into a luminous dawn, symbolizing salvation and inner rebirth through divine wisdom."
